# Caf-Sales-Analysis-with-Dirty-Data
This project is a simulation of a real-world sales report analysis, which is analyzing data to uncover sales, customer spending habbit and item performancs in order to get insights for marketing campaigns, promotions, and product strategy.

---

## Files Included
- `Dirty_data_cafe_sales_analysis.xlsx` – Cleaned and processed sales dataset  
- Dashboards summarizing:
  - Monthly sales trends  
  - Average daily sales and customer traffic  
  - Customer spending groups and item preferences  
  - Payment method and location preferences  

---

## Objectives
- Understand overall **sales trends** and **customer purchasing behavior**
- Identify **high-value and low-value products** to optimize product mix
- Analyze **customer traffic patterns** to support targeted promotions
- Simulate how a business would analyze a **sales performance report**
- Provide **data-driven recommendations** for marketing strategies

## Data Cleaning & Processing
The original dataset contained missing, inconsistent, and unclear data. The following steps were performed:

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Trimmed text and aligned formats using Excel functions (e.g., `PROPER`)
- Removed duplicate records
- Filtered invalid transactions (e.g., missing transaction dates and payment method errors)
- Deleted unused columns while keeping the raw data intact

### 2. Data Recovery & Calculations
- Calculated missing data by using different formulas:
- Built an item unit price reference table to identify unknown items
- Recovered and standardized transaction information where possible

### 3. Analysis & Visualization
- Created heatmaps for **average daily sales by month**
- Analyzed **customer spending groups** and estimated potential revenue growth
- Built **two dashboards** to visualize sales trends and customer purchasing behavior
